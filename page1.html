                        Hello, my name is <strong>Alwyn Kent M. Macatangay</strong>, and I am the owner of this website. Currently, I am a first-year college student pursuing a <u>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</u> at Batangas State University: Alangilan Campus. While I am still learning, I gather information from various resources and am gradually building my understanding of web development.

                    <p style="font-size: 23px;">
                        I was born on <b>August 11</b>, and at <b>19 years old</b>, I have always enjoyed hands-on work. This is why I find myself gravitating toward fields that involve practical application. Although web development doesn't fully align with my interests, I am still exploring and learning about it. My real passion lies in <b>Robotics</b>, and I plan to join the <u>SCRIPT organization</u> in the future. As a member of the <u>Junior Philippine Computer Society</u>, I continue to grow and explore different facets of college life.
